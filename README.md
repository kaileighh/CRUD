Kaileigh Hermann CRUD Assignment


This rails app is a combination of a Calendar and an appointment book. You are able to list appointments with dates, times and locations. 
Throughout the completion of this assignment I was able to better understand the file format of rails apps, and spent a significant amount of time discovering how each part of the app connects to the others in the files, a concept that was very confusing to me. 
I feel confident about the creation of scaffolds, but have not been able to figure out how to connect objects without recieving errors.
